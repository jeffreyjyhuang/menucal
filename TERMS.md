## Google Account

The App requires you to sign in with a Google account to access your calendar data. By signing in, you authorize the App to access your Google Calendar in read-only mode. The App does not modify, create, or delete any data in your Google account. Your use of Google services is also subject to [Google's Terms of Service](https://policies.google.com/terms).

## No Warranty

The App is provided "as is" and "as available" without warranties of any kind, either express or implied. We do not guarantee that the App will be uninterrupted, error-free, or free of harmful components. Calendar data accuracy depends on Google's services and your account settings.

## Limitation of Liability

To the fullest extent permitted by law, the developer shall not be liable for any indirect, incidental, special, consequential, or punitive damages, or any loss of data, use, or profits, arising out of or in connection with your use of the App.

## Third-Party Services

The App relies on Google Calendar API to function. We are not responsible for the availability, accuracy, or reliability of Google's services. Changes to Google's API or terms may affect the App's functionality.

## Termination
