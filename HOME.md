## Features

**Always visible** — See today's date and a countdown to your next meeting right in the menu bar. No need to open a separate app.

**Full calendar view** — Click the menu bar to open a clean monthly calendar with event details for any day.

**Google Calendar sync** — Connects to your Google Workspace calendar with read-only access. Events refresh automatically every five minutes.

**Customizable display** — Choose what shows in the menu bar: date, time (12h or 24h, with optional seconds), and event countdown. Toggle each independently.

**Resizable popover** — Pick between small, medium, or large popover sizes to fit your workflow.

**Privacy-first** — All data stays on your Mac. No servers, no analytics, no tracking. Tokens are stored securely in the macOS Keychain.
